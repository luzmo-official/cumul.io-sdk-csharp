# Cumul.io API

## ⚠️⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE⚠️⚠️

The library had been replaced by `LuzmoSDK. You can find the new package on the GitHub repo [luzmo-official/luzmo-sdk-csharp](https://github.com/luzmo-official/luzmo-sdk-csharp).

---

You can use this C# project to interact with the [Cumul.io](https://cumul.io) API in order to create, modify or delete datasets, dashboards or push new data into the platform in a programmatic way.

## Usage

See the `Cumulio API/Example.cs` file for examples how to create datasets or push data into the platform (triggering real-time dashboard updates).
See the `EmbeddedCumulio` project to see an example of how to use the API to securely embed dashboards in an ASP.NET MVC web application (with serverside pre-filtering of the data that the end-user can query).

## Documentation

The API documentation (available services and methods) can be found [here](https://developer.cumul.io/).
